        the Mutual Force Terms of Service (“Terms of Service”).  Capitalized terms 
        not defined in this Billing and Payment Service Policy are defined in the 
        Terms of Service. <br/>
        This Billing and Payment Service Policy is effective as of Sep 1, 2011. 
        Your continued use of the Site after such time will signify your acceptance 
        of this Billing and Payment Service Policy.  We reserve the right to modify

    </p>

    <h2>INTRODUCTION </h2>
    <p>
        The Mutual Force Billing and Payment Service ("Payment Service") enables 
        Employers (Employer) to make payments to Mutual Force LLC. When Employer 
        (Employer) makes a payment through the Payment Service, Mutual Force 
        deducts a certain percentage of commission (subject to changes) due to 
        Mutual Force and forwards the rest to the Ex-employee who provides the 
        knowledge transfer. Mutual Force also charges a monthly fee for its service
        to the Employers. The Payment Service is intended for business use, so you
        agree to use the Payment Service primarily for business, and not primarily 
        for personal, family, or household purposes. 
    </p>

    <h2>MANDATORY USE OF BILLING AND PAYMENT SERVICE </h2>
    <p>
        As a Employer, and for all Ex-Employees you plan to use for knowledge 
        transfer via the Site on or after Sep 1, 2011, you agree to use the Payment
        Service to make all payments to an Ex-Employee, for a period of 24 months 
        after you start working with the individual for the knowledge transfer 
        through the Site, whether first-time, repeat, or follow-on. You also agree
        not to take any action directly or indirectly to circumvent the Mutual 
        Force Service Fee. <br/>
        As an individual, and for all Ex-employers you identify via the Site on or 
        after Sep 1, 2011, you agree to use the Payment Service to receive all 
        payments from an Ex-employer for a period of 24 months after you identify 
        the Ex-employer through the Site, whether first-time, repeat, or follow-on 
        ("24 Month Payments"). In addition, you acknowledge and agree that an 
        Ex-employer is not obligated to pay any invoice to you unless you 
        originated that invoice through the Payment Service. 
    </p>

    <h2>NON-CIRCUMVENTION OF PAYMENT SERVICE </h2>
    <p>
        You agree not to circumvent the Payment Service. Prohibited acts include 
        (but are not limited to) the following: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> 
            Submitting proposals or soliciting Employers identified on the Site to
            contact, hire, manage or pay outside the Site. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Accepting proposals from or soliciting Ex-Employees identified on the 
            Site to contact, deliver Ex-Employee Services, invoice, or receive 
            payment outside the Site.
        </li>
        <li>
            Invoicing or reporting on the Site an invoice or payment amount 
            different than that agreed between Employer and Ex-Employee.  
        </li>
     </ol>
    <p>
        As a Employer, you agree to notify Mutual Force immediately if your 
        Ex-Employee solicits payment from you outside the Site. As a Ex-Employee, 
        you agree to notify Mutual Force immediately if your Employer seeks to pay
        you outside the Site. If you are aware of a breach of the foregoing 
        prohibitions, or any potential circumvention of the Payment Service, please
        submit a confidential report to Mutual Force by sending an email to us at 
        the following email address: 
        <a href="mailto:sales@mutualforce.com">sales@mutualforce.com</a>. 
    </p>

    <h2>LEGAL NATURE OF PAYMENT SERVICE </h2>
    <p>
        When you use the Payment Service to bill for or pay service fees, Mutual 
        Force acts as your agent based upon your direction and your requirements 
        to perform tasks on your behalf. Mutual Force holds your Account funds 
        separate from its corporate operating accounts, and will not voluntarily 
        make your funds available to its creditors in the event of a bankruptcy or 
        for any other purpose.  As provided in United States Bankruptcy Code, 
        Section 541(d), Mutual Force shall hold only legal title to, and not have
        any equitable interest in, the Account and any funds in it. <br/>
        Mutual Force LLC IS NOT A BANK, AND AMOUNTS TRANSFERRED THROUGH OR STORED 
        IN THE PAYMENT SERVICE ARE NOT INSURED DEPOSITS. You will not receive 
        interest or other earnings on the funds in your Account. Mutual Force may 
        earn and retain interest on those funds, may charge or deduct fees, may 
        receive a reduction in fees or expenses charged, or may receive other 
        compensation for banking, payment or other financial services related to 
        the Account. 
        By initiating invoices and sending payments through the Payment Service or 
        adding funds to your Account, you appoint Mutual Force as your agent to 
        obtain the funds on your behalf and to transfer the funds to the recipient
        that you designate, subject to the terms and conditions of this Billing 
        and Payment Service Policy and the Mutual Force Terms of Service. Each 
        Ex-Employee must properly discharge and credit Employers for all payments 
        that Mutual Force receives through the Payment Service from such Employers.
    </p>

    <h2>No Responsibility for Ex-Employee Services or Employer Payments </h2>
    <p>
        Mutual Force acts as a payment provider by creating, hosting, maintaining, 
        and providing the Payment Service to you via the Internet. Mutual Force 
        does not have any control over the Ex-Employee Services invoiced or paid 
        for with the Payment Service, nor whether a Employer or Ex-Employee you are
        dealing with will actually complete the transaction. Nothing in the Payment
        Service will be deemed to constitute Mutual Force your agent with respect 
        to any Ex-Employee Services purchased and sold by Users through the Site, 
        or expand or modify any warranty, liability or indemnity stated in these 
        Terms of Service. 
    </p>

    <h2>Disputes Between Employers and Ex-Employees </h2>
    <p>
        Any disputes in connection with services provided by Ex-Employees or 
        payments made by Employers remain between such Employers and Ex-Employees. 
        By using any Payment Service, you agree to follow the Dispute Resolution 
        Process. You further acknowledge that Mutual Force will not be a party to 
        any such dispute. Mutual Force will attempt to take the actions set forth 
        in the Dispute Resolution Process, but Mutual Force will not be obligated 
        to take any other action or refrain from taking any other action toward 
        resolving any such dispute. <br/>
        Mutual Force may, at its sole discretion, and in the case of Escrow 
        Knowledge Transfe may be required to, withhold or delay payment or 
        continue to hold amounts in Escrow or make payment or release funds in 
        Escrow, in the event of dispute between a Employer and a Ex-Employee.

    <h2>MISCELLANEOUS PAYMENT SERVICE TERMS</h2>
    <h2>Authorized Payments are Final </h2>
    <p>
        Your use of the Payment Service constitutes your agreement to pay for any 
        amounts that you authorize us to charge against your Account and, as 
        appropriate, your credit card, bank account, or PayPal. Such 
        payments, once authorized, are final. 
    </p>

    <h2>Erroneous or Duplicate Transactions; Charge Backs </h2>
    <p>
        Mutual Force reserves the right to seek reimbursement from you, and you 
        will reimburse Mutual Force, if Mutual Force discovers erroneous or 
        duplicate transactions, or Mutual Force receives a charge back from any 
        Employer's credit card company, bank, or PayPal for any reason. You agree 
        that Mutual Force has the right to obtain such reimbursement by charging
        your Account, deducting amounts from future payments or withdrawals, 
        charging your credit card, or obtaining reimbursement from you by any 
        other lawful means. Failure to pay for reimbursements of charge backs is 
        cause for termination of your Account. 
    </p>

    <h2>Currency </h2>
    <p>
        The Payment Service operates in US Dollars and therefore Mutual Force is 
        not responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when billing or 
        crediting a credit or debit card denominated in a currency other than US 
        Dollars, nor is Mutual Force responsible for currency fluctuations that 
        occur when receiving or sending payment via wire transfer, check or 
        automated clearinghouse to and from your Account. Payments made to Mutual 
        Force in currency other than US Dollars may take up to eight weeks to 
        process, depending on relationships among the banking and payment systems 
        between the two countries. Consequently, balance adjustments may be delayed. 
    </p>

    <h2>Agreement to Pay</h2>
    <p>
        If, for any reason, Mutual Force does not receive payment for any amounts 
        that you have authorized to be paid through your use of the Payment Service
        or other Mutual Force Services, you agree to pay such amount immediately 
        upon demand by Mutual Force. You also agree to pay any interest charges, 
        attorneys’ fees and other costs of collection incurred by Mutual Force in 
        collecting from you the authorized but unpaid amount. In such case, Mutual 
        Force may, at its option, stop processing any further payments made by you
        and apply any amounts then held by Mutual Force on your behalf toward any 
        deficiencies, losses or costs that we have incurred as a result of your use
        of the Payment Service or other Mutual Force Service. We may also make 
        appropriate reports to credit reporting agencies, financial institutions, 
        tax agencies and law enforcement authorities, and cooperate with them in 
        any resulting investigation or prosecution. 
    </p>

    <h2>Inactive Accounts; Abandoned Accounts </h2>
    <p>
        For purposes of determining Inactive Account status and Abandoned Account 
        status, "activity" means payment of subscription fees, payment or receipt 
        of Job fees, or actions under the Dispute Resolution Process.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Inactive Accounts. If your Account has a balance, but has had no activity 
        for at least five (5) consecutive months, your Account will be placed on 
        "Inactive" status. Mutual Force will notify you that your Account is 
        Inactive by sending an email to your registered email address and give you 
        the option of keeping your Account open and maintaining the balance or 
        withdrawing the balance. If, within thirty (30) days of such notice, your 
        account has no activity, Mutual Force will automatically deduct an Inactive 
        Account Fee of $5, or the entire balance of your Account if such balance 
        is less than $5, per month thereafter, to recover administrative costs of 
        holding funds. Mutual Force will cease such deductions if subsequently (i) 
        your Account has activity or (ii) your Account no longer has a balance. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Abandoned Accounts. If your Account has a balance, but it has had no 
        activity for at least 18 consecutive months or has been on Inactive status 
        for at least 12 consecutive months, Mutual Force will automatically close 
        your Account and attempt to either (a) wire transfer the entire Account 
        balance to your registered bank account, or (b) mail a check in the amount 
        of your entire Account balance to your registered mailing address. If those
        attempts fail, the Account balance may escheat to the State of New Jersey.
